### Hi, I'm Patricia ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated iOS Developer, willing to learn and exchange knowledge.
Using Swift and SwiftUI, my goal is to build clear code to develop functional and user-friendly applications, promoting the best experience to the users.
 
Apart of working and studying, I love pushing myself to develop new skills, or old ones like playing keyboard (used to play when I was a child), running (planning a half marathon this year) and writing with my left hand (well.. weird dream since I was a kid).

I love travelling even though I always end up going home (Brazil) or to Italy (never get enough of good food and good views).

Happy to connect and exchange knowledge.
