### Hi, I'm Patricia ðŸ‘‹

I am Physiotherapist and Pilates Instructor for over 13 years. After all these years working with the human body I felt it was time to change, to learn something new. And here I am.
I decided to learn coding as a challenge and guess what?! I loved it!
I am currently finishing my iOS App Development Bootcamp while still teaching Pilates.
Can't wait to start working with it, so until then.

Apart of working and studying, I love pushing myself to develop new skills, or old ones like playing keyboard (used to play when I was a child), running (planning a half marathon this year) and writing with my left hand (well.. weird dream since I was a kid).

I love travelling even though I always end up going home (Brazil) or to Italy (never get enough of good food and good views).

Happy to connect and exchange knowledge.
